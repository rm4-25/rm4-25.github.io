[Miami as Ground Zero: Tracing the Magic City's Environmental History and Future](https://news.miami.edu/as/stories/2025/05/exploring-our-changing-south-florida-landscape.html)

Miami as Ground Zero is a three-year project funded by the Mellon Foundation that aims to create an interactive digital timeline highlighting the historical relationship between urban growth and environmental change in South Florida. I joined the project in Fall 2025 as a primary researcher. I worked directly with archival material and input metadata, notes, and tags into the project database.

[The Cuban Theater Digital Archive](http://ctda.library.miami.edu/)

The Cuban Theater Digital Archive (CTDA) is a resource for research, teaching and learning in Cuban theater and performance as well as in related fields; a community repository for improtant Cuban theatrical materials; and a forum to foster scholarly communication in this field. Over the summer of 2025, I was awarded a University of Miami graduate fellowship to work as an Assistant Editor to CTDA under the direction of Dr. Lillian Manzor. 

[Listening in/to South Florida](https://rm4-25.github.io/lsf_3/)

This is a Digital Environmental Humanities project created by University of Miami doctoral students 
in the department of Modern Languages and Literature and English & Creative Writing over the Spring 2025 semester. The
project's guiding research question asks "How do our forms of connection to the environment reflect our relationship with it?"
We created a Leaflet Story Map as an attempt to answer this question through sounds captured throughout South Florida.
